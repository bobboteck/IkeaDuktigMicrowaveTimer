# IKEA DUKTIG Microwave Timer [![Go to Italian version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/bobboteck/IkeaDuktigMicrowaveTimer/images/80x40-Italy.png)](README-IT.md)

IKEA DUKTIG it is a simple toy for our children, it only has a dummy induction hob that can be turned on electronically, to give the feeling of a real kitchen.

One day my daughter, seeing me use the "real" microwave in the kitchen, said to me: "Daddy, my microwave oven doesn't have the numbers!", I immediately replied that I would build the "numbers" for his oven.

While here is a video showing how it works:

As you can see, there is a lot of free space in the front panel, in the final analysis I chose this solution that closes everything, in the future I could use that space to add other features.
